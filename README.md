These tools are written in Python using flasks (RestAPI). In general there are 3 tools: HTTP, nslookup, Synflood ad in addition some basic client-server socket communication. Open The app.py first(for the 3 tools) and follow the instructions above. In orderr to see the client-server you will need to run them separately (protocol script is connected to them). SynFloodSample.pcap file is for the synflood tool, and the webroot folder is for the HTTP tool. ENJOY:)
