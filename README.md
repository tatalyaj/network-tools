These tools are written in Python using flasks (RestAPI). In general there are 3 tools: HTTP, nslookup, Synflood, in addition there are some scripts representing some basic client-server socket communication. 
Open The app.py first(for the 3 tools) and follow the instructions written at the top of the script. 
In order to see the client-server function, you will need to run them separately (first the server then the client) the protocol script is connected to them. SynFloodSample.pcap file is for the synflood tool, and the webroot folder is for the HTTP tool.
